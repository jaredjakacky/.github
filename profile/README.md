# Jakacky Labs

Jakacky Labs is a personal software lab for building, testing, and exploring. It’s a space for engineering work, tools, data projects, and whatever else seems worth digging into.

## What This Is

Not everything here is polished. Some of it’s infrastructure code, some of it’s data-heavy, some of it’s just curiosity with a keyboard.

Jakacky Labs serves as:
- A sandbox for prototypes and scratchpad ideas  
- A place to build tools that solve real problems  
- A working archive of past and ongoing projects

## Projects

Some work is public, some stays private. Topics vary, but tend to center around:

- Infrastructure, automation, and internal tooling  
- Data systems, storage, and the stuff that moves between them  
- Systems design, performance, and operational sanity  
- One-off experiments that might go somewhere—or not

## Notes

Jakacky Labs is independent and unaffiliated with any employer, past or present.
