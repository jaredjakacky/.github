# Jared Jakacky

Software engineer working across product and platform on systems that run continuously and are maintained by teams over time.

Most of my work has been on software that integrates with other systems, accumulates operational history, and needs to remain understandable long after its initial release. That work has spanned backend services, infrastructure and platform tooling, data systems, and user-facing applications, often in environments where reliability and correctness matter as much as delivery speed.

Earlier work in clinical and research settings shaped how I think about validation, repeatability, and responsibility. That perspective still shows up in how I approach software design, deployment, and operation.
