# Jared Jakacky

Software Engineer with experience building and operating production systems across a wide range of domains.

My work includes backend services, infrastructure and platform tooling, data systems, and user-facing applications. I’ve spent much of my career writing software that runs continuously, integrates with other systems, and must be maintained by teams over long periods of time.

## Background

My professional work has included:

- Building and operating Kubernetes-based platforms
- Designing and maintaining CI/CD and deployment workflows
- Working directly with relational and non-relational databases
- Developing backend services and APIs
- Building and maintaining user-facing applications
- Supporting systems used in regulated and high-reliability environments

Earlier in my career, I worked in clinical and research settings where correctness, repeatability, and validation were required. That experience continues to influence how I approach software design and operation.
